Same Random faction for all teams.

Planned features:

* ''Shift'' factions/leaders. For example, if there are 6 players, order will be: A - c - B - a - C - b. This is how ''Creep Wars'' map currently works.
* Prefer explicit user choice instead of random choice if it does not contradict mirroring (currently implemented only for first side in each team).
